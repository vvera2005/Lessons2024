1. Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

2. Write a program that takes a list of numbers for example
a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

3. Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.
For example, say I type the string:
  My name is Mamikon
Then I would see the string:
  Mamikon is name My


4. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

5. Write a Dart program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number.

6. Write a Dart program that calculates and prints the sum of the even numbers using a for loop.

7. Write a Dart program that prints the following pattern using nested loops:
*
**
***
****
*****

8. Write a Dart program that generates and prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
