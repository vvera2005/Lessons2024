1. Create a Dart program that reads a text file named "input.txt" and prints its contents to the console.

2. Write a Dart function that takes a filename and a string as parameters and writes the string to the specified file.

3. Extend the program to check if the file "output.txt" exists. If it does, append the contents of "input.txt" to "output.txt"; otherwise, create a new "output.txt" file.

4. Read the contents of "person.json", deserialize it and print the person's information to the console.
person.json content - 
{
	"employees":[  
    	{"name":"Shyam", "email":"shyamjaiswal@gmail.com"},  
    	{"name":"Bob", "email":"bob32@gmail.com"},  
    	{"name":"Jai", "email":"jai87@gmail.com"}

		]
	}
